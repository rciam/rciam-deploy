# Ansible Playbooks for deploying AAI for Research and Collaboration

A collection of playbooks for setting up a proxy-based Authentication & Authorisation Infrastracture (AAI) for Research and Collaboration. 

Currently, the master playbook (`site.yml`) supports setting up the following components:

* IdP/SP proxy based on one or more instances of [SimpleSAMLphp](https://simplesamlphp.org) (see `authservers.yml` playook)
* cluster of [memcached](https://memcached.org/) servers for caching user sessions in a distributed way to enable load-balancing and fail-over (see `cacheservers.yml` playbook)
* reverse proxy based on [nginx](https://nginx.org/) to support HTTP request load balancing among multiple SimpleSAMLphp web front-ends that use the back-end matrix of memcached servers (see `webproxyservers.yml` playbook)

## Managed Node Requirements

On the managed nodes, you need a way to communicate, normally ssh, which by default uses sftp. If this is not available you can switch to scp in `ansible.cfg`. You will also need the following packages:

* `python` (version 2.4 or later)
* `python-simplejson` (only if you are running less than Python 2.5)
* `sudo` (unless the default ansible `become_method` is overriden)

## Control Machine Requirements

On the control machine, you need a recent version of Ansible. We recommend installing Ansible via ‚Äúpip‚Äù, which is the Python package manager (though other options are also available):

```sh
pip install ansible==2.9.11
pip install dnspython
ansible-galaxy install ipr-cnrs.nftables
ansible-galaxy install arillso.logrotate
üç∫
```

## Configuration

* Set the hostnames/IP addresses of managed nodes in `inventories/ENV/inventory`, for each target environment, e.g. `testing`, `staging`, `production`, etc.
* DO change the default SimpleSAMLphp admin password in `inventories/ENV/group_vars/authservers`
* Modify variables in `inventories/ENV/group_vars/authservers` to generate the metadata of the IdP/SP proxy 

## Executing the Playbook

Assuming root access to the target machines, simple run the following command to execute the master playbook using the inventory file at the default location (see `ansible.cfg`):

```sh
ansible-playbook -v site.yml
```
